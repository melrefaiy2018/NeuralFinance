## Abstract

**Neural Finance** is a research-oriented deep learning framework for predictive modeling of financial time series. The framework integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks with technical indicators and sentiment analysis pipelines, enabling comprehensive temporal modeling of asset prices. It aims to address non-stationary characteristics of financial data, multi-scale temporal dependencies, and the integration of qualitative sentiment information, providing a platform for rigorous scientific experimentation and evaluation.

---

## Introduction

Predicting financial time series remains a fundamentally challenging task due to the stochastic nature of markets, the influence of exogenous events, and inherent noise. Neural Finance was designed to systematically study the efficacy of multi-modal architectures that combine quantitative price-based features with qualitative sentiment signals extracted from external sources. By implementing a modular dual-branch LSTM architecture, the framework facilitates systematic investigation of hypotheses regarding temporal patterns, market sentiment integration, and the predictive utility of technical indicators.

---

## Key Scientific Contributions

* **Hybrid LSTM Architecture**: Dual-branch architecture explicitly separates market data and sentiment data processing before feature fusion, allowing independent and joint hypothesis testing.
* **Adaptive Indicator Framework**: Parameterized computation of technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, MA, EMA, and ROC supports reproducible experimentation with different window sizes and indicator sets.
* **Sentiment Integration Pipeline**: Modular sentiment analysis submodule facilitates controlled integration of external textual signals, enabling ablation studies on the impact of sentiment on predictive performance.
* **Validation Protocols**: Incorporates walk-forward validation, directional accuracy, and error metrics (RMSE, MAE) to support statistically rigorous performance evaluation.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/melrefaiy2018/neural_finance.git
cd neural_finance
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Core Functionality

* **Data Acquisition**: Retrieve historical price data via yfinance API.
* **Technical Indicators**: Compute RSI, MACD, EMA, MA, and ROC with adjustable parameters.
* **LSTM Modeling**: Train and evaluate models with configurable hyperparameters.
* **Sentiment Analysis Framework**: Process external news or social media sentiment for integration into the predictive model.
* **Visualization**: Generate time series plots of true vs predicted prices and technical indicator overlays.
* **Portfolio Analysis**: Evaluate expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratios.
* **Web Interface**: Interactive Flask-based application for running analyses without direct scripting.

## Model Configuration Example

```python
from neural_finance.config import ModelConfig
from neural_finance import StockAnalyzer

config = ModelConfig(
    lstm_units=128,
    dropout_rate=0.2,
    epochs=100,
    batch_size=32,
    sequence_length=60,
    technical_indicators=['RSI', 'MACD'],
    prediction_horizon=5
)

analyzer = StockAnalyzer(config=config)
```

---

## Validation Metrics

Model performance is quantitatively evaluated using:

* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Directional Accuracy (percentage of correct movement predictions)
* Sharpe Ratio (portfolio analysis)

Walk-forward validation is implemented to mitigate look-ahead bias and provide a robust estimate of model generalization on unseen data.

---

## Limitations

* **Sentiment Coverage**: Current implementation supports basic sentiment integration; real-time sentiment ingestion and advanced NLP pipelines remain in development.
* **Backtesting Framework**: Historical strategy simulation is partially implemented, with plans for advanced event-driven backtesting.
* **API Constraints**: Free-tier data sources (e.g., yfinance) impose rate limits and may introduce data latency.

---

## System Requirements

* Minimum: 8GB RAM, multi-core CPU.
* Recommended: 16GB RAM.
* Software: Python 3.8+, TensorFlow 2.x, pandas, numpy, yfinance, scikit-learn, Flask.
