# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Alpha Release

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the alpha release of the `stock_prediction_lstm` package. The goal of this release is to provide a stable and well-documented version of the package for early testing and feedback.

## 2. Key Findings

### 2.1. Security

- **Hardcoded API Keys:** Critical security vulnerability found in `stock_prediction_lstm/data/fetchers/AlternativeSentimentSources.py`. Hardcoded API keys were present in the source code.
- **`.gitignore`:** The `.gitignore` file in `stock_prediction_lstm/config/keys/` correctly ignores `api_keys.py`, which is a good security practice.

### 2.2. File Analysis

- **Unused Files:** The `web/junk` directory contained temporary and debugging files that were not part of the main application.
- **Temporary Directories:** The `examples/advanced_analysis_20250705_003509` directory was identified as a temporary output directory.
- **`__pycache__` directories:** No `__pycache__` directories were found in the project.
- **`.DS_Store` files:** No `.DS_Store` files were found in the project.

### 2.3. Documentation

- **Docstring Coverage:** The overall docstring coverage for the project is 54.7%, which is below the recommended 80% for a production-ready package. Several files have 0% docstring coverage.

## 3. Recommendations for Alpha Release

### 3.1. High Priority

- **Remove Hardcoded API Keys:** All hardcoded API keys must be removed from the source code and replaced with placeholders or a secure configuration method.
- **Add Missing Docstrings:** Add docstrings to all undocumented functions, classes, and modules. The goal is to achieve a docstring coverage of at least 80%.

### 3.2. Medium Priority

- **Review and Refactor:** Review the code for any other potential issues, such as dead code, commented-out code, and inconsistent coding styles.
- **Improve Error Handling:** Improve the error handling in the code to provide more informative error messages to the user.

### 3.3. Low Priority

- **Update `README.md`:** Update the `README.md` file with the latest information about the package, including installation instructions, usage examples, and API documentation.
- **Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file:** Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to provide guidelines for other developers who want to contribute to the project.

## 4. Action Plan

1.  **Remove Hardcoded API Keys:** The hardcoded API keys in `stock_prediction_lstm/data/fetchers/AlternativeSentimentSources.py` have been replaced with placeholders.
2.  **Delete Unused Files:** The `web/junk` and `examples/advanced_analysis_20250705_003509` directories have been deleted.
3.  **Add Missing Docstrings:** Add docstrings to the files with low docstring coverage, starting with the files with 0% coverage.
4.  **Review and Refactor:** Review the code for any other potential issues.
5.  **Update Documentation:** Update the `README.md` and create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

By addressing these issues, we can ensure that the alpha release of the `stock_prediction_lstm` package is stable, secure, and well-documented.
