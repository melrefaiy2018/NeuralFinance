## Summary of Work Done and Remaining Tasks for Alpha Release

This document summarizes the progress made in preparing the `stock_prediction_lstm` package for its alpha release, highlighting completed tasks and outstanding issues.

### Work Done:

1.  **Security Enhancement:**
    *   Identified and removed hardcoded API keys from `stock_prediction_lstm/data/fetchers/AlternativeSentimentSources.py`, replacing them with placeholders to prevent sensitive data exposure.

2.  **Codebase Cleanup:**
    *   Deleted the `web/junk` directory, which contained temporary and debugging files.
    *   Removed the `examples/advanced_analysis_20250705_003509` directory, identified as a temporary output of an example script.

3.  **Documentation Improvement:**
    *   Added comprehensive docstrings to numerous Python files across various modules, including `analysis`, `data` (fetchers, processors, storage), `models`, `utils`, `web`, `config`, and `cli`.
    *   Updated the main `README.md` to reflect the current state of the project, including new features, installation instructions, and API key setup.
    *   Created a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to provide clear guidelines for future contributions.

4.  **Code Formatting:**
    *   Initiated code formatting using `black` to ensure consistent style across the codebase. (Note: One file failed due to a syntax error).

### Remaining Issues for Alpha Release:

1.  **Critical Syntax Error in `flask_app.py`:**
    *   A persistent `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal` exists in `stock_prediction_lstm/web/flask_app.py` at line 1198. This error is currently blocking automated tools like `interrogate`, `flake8`, and `mypy` from completing their checks on the entire codebase. **This issue requires manual intervention to resolve.**

2.  **Full Docstring Coverage Verification:**
    *   Due to the blocking syntax error, a complete and accurate docstring coverage report cannot be generated. While significant progress has been made in adding docstrings, a final verification is needed once the syntax issue is resolved.

3.  **Testing:**
    *   Automated tests have not yet been executed to verify the functionality of the changes made. Running the test suite (`pytest`) is crucial to ensure stability and correctness before the alpha release.

4.  **Linting and Type Checking Completion:**
    *   `flake8` and `mypy` could not complete their checks due to the `SyntaxError`. These tools should be run successfully after the syntax error is resolved to ensure code quality and type correctness.

**Next Steps Recommended:**

*   **Prioritize fixing the `SyntaxError` in `stock_prediction_lstm/web/flask_app.py` manually.**
*   Once the syntax error is resolved, run `interrogate` to get a final docstring coverage report and address any remaining gaps.
*   Execute the full test suite (`pytest`) to validate all functionalities.
*   Run `flake8` and `mypy` to ensure code quality and type consistency across the entire project.
